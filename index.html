  About <a href="http://github.com/donnadietz"> me</a>: 

<P>
I was born in Dallas, Texas, raised on Grand Island, New York, and
then went to college at Atlantic Union College (in Massachusetts),
earning a BS in Mathematics with minors in Computer Science and
Computer Information Systems. I have an MS in Mathematics from UMass
Lowell and a PHD in Applied Mathematics from Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute (RPI, near Albany, NY). I've taught at UMass Lowell, RPI,
Hudson Valley Community College, The College of Saint Rose, Mansfield
University, The Univeristy of Pennsylvania, and am currently teaching
at American University.

<p>

My first job was lifeguarding, and I've also taught swimming. I play
the violin. I
  am married to <a href="http://www.github.com/kb1dds">Michael Robinson</a> and we
have three sons.
